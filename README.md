# 7-Color-Changing-LED-Wand

Thank you [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/RAT) for sponsoring this project.

This magic wand is a color changing wand that can cast 7 different colors - Red, Green, Blue, Yellow, Cyan, Magenta, and White by setting the switch to the correct combinations.

Please buy the RGB LEDs that has the sequence R positive G B.

There are 32 LEDs in total with 16 LEDs on each side.

The resistors are carefully chosen to regulate the current to the LEDs.

The current to each LED color is 20 mA.

The voltage difference between the Red and the Green or Blue is 1 V.

A resistor of 75 ohm is used in series with the Red LED.

R = 51 ohm resistance is needed for Green and Blue LEDs each.

Most of the components are through hole as 5mm RGB LEDs.

For the supply voltage, we can solder a USB C female board to the VCC and GND copper pads.
